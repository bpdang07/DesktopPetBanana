Recreating the desktop pet with banana cat

Sprite taken from here "https://mrminhfly.itch.io/banana-cat-sprite-asset" made from mrminhfly

Right now, its just a basic Desktop thats on top of the windows you load, As i know it works with windows, however i am unsure how well godot applications work well with MacOS. 

I plan in the near future to make this pet more interative, like tapping makes it does something, or you can put down Banana Cat with a swift weapon.
